# scRNA_seq_analysis

## Objective

To develop a shareable and simple single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline, applicable to custom input data. This pipeline will facilitate reproducible and scalable scRNA-seq data processing and analysis.

## Proposed Technology Stack

Based on current best practices and requirements, we propose the following technology stack:

*   **Workflow Management**: **Nextflow**
    *   *Rationale*: Excellent for creating scalable and reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. It manages dependencies, parallelizes tasks, and supports various execution environments. The existing [nf-core/scrnaseq pipeline](https://github.com/nf-core/scrnaseq) is a testament to its capabilities in this domain.
*   **Programming Language**: **Python**
    *   *Rationale*: Widely used in bioinformatics for data manipulation, analysis, and custom scripting. Libraries like Scanpy, AnnData, Pandas, and NumPy are invaluable for scRNA-seq analysis. Python scripts can be seamlessly integrated as processes within a Nextflow workflow.
*   **Version Control**: **Git**
    *   *Rationale*: The standard for version control, essential for tracking changes, collaboration, and maintaining a history of the pipeline's development.
*   **Containerization**: **Apptainer (formerly Singularity)** & **Docker**
    *   *Rationale*: Apptainer/Singularity is preferred for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments due to its security model (it doesn't require root privileges to run containers). Docker is excellent for development and local execution. Nextflow natively supports both, allowing for flexible deployment. The `nf-core/scrnaseq` pipeline also supports both.

## Pipeline Overview & Inspiration

We can draw significant inspiration from established, best-practice pipelines like `nf-core/scrnaseq`. A typical scRNA-seq workflow, which we can adapt for simplicity, involves:

1.  **Input Data**:
    *   Raw sequencing data (e.g., FASTQ files: R1 and R2 for paired-end reads).
    *   A samplesheet (e.g., CSV format) to provide metadata, linking samples to their respective FASTQ files and other relevant information (e.g., expected cell count, protocol type).
2.  **Preprocessing & Quantification**:
    *   Alignment of reads to a reference genome/transcriptome and quantification of gene expression per cell.
    *   Tools like STARsolo, Kallisto/BUStools, or Alevin-fry (as supported by `nf-core/scrnaseq`) are common choices.
    *   This step typically generates count matrices (e.g., in MTX format).
3.  **Quality Control (QC)**:
    *   Filtering out empty droplets, low-quality cells, and potentially uninformative genes.
    *   Calculating various QC metrics (e.g., percentage of mitochondrial reads, number of genes detected per cell, total UMI counts per cell).
4.  **Downstream Analysis (Primarily Python-based)**:
    *   Data normalization and scaling.
    *   Feature selection.
    *   Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, UMAP, t-SNE).
    *   Cell clustering.
    *   Identification of marker genes for clusters.
    *   Cell type annotation (optional, can be manual or automated).
    *   The AnnData (`.h5ad`) format is highly recommended for storing and manipulating scRNA-seq data in Python (e.g., with Scanpy).

## Implementation Strategy

1.  **Nextflow Workflow (`main.nf`)**:
    *   Define the main workflow logic, chaining together different processes.
    *   Organize individual bioinformatics tools or script executions as Nextflow `process` blocks.
    *   Consider structuring processes into `modules` for better organization, similar to nf-core practices.
    *   Utilize Nextflow `channels` to manage the flow of data between processes.
2.  **Python Scripts for Analysis**:
    *   Develop modular Python scripts for specific analysis tasks (e.g., QC, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering using Scanpy).
    *   These scripts will be called by Nextflow processes, taking input files (e.g., count matrices) and producing output files (e.g., filtered matrices, `.h5ad` objects, plots).
3.  **Containerization with Apptainer/Singularity & Docker**:
    *   Create Apptainer/Singularity definition files (or use existing ones from nf-core/Docker Hub) for each process or group of related processes. These files specify all necessary software dependencies (Python, R, specific bioinformatics tools, libraries, and correct versions).
    *   Nextflow will use these containers to ensure a consistent and reproducible runtime environment across different systems.
4.  **Configuration (`nextflow.config`)**:
    *   Use Nextflow configuration files to manage pipeline parameters (e.g., paths to reference genomes, QC thresholds, algorithm choices).
    *   Define resource allocations (CPU, memory, time) for different processes.
    *   Set up `profiles` for different execution environments (e.g., `local`, `hpc`, `docker`, `singularity`). This makes it easy to run the pipeline in various settings with a simple command-line switch.

## Getting Started (Conceptual Outline)

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Install Nextflow.
    *   Install Docker (for local runs/container building) or Apptainer/Singularity (for HPC).
2.  **Prepare Inputs**:
    *   Reference genome FASTA and gene annotation GTF files.
    *   A `samplesheet.csv` describing your input samples and FASTQ files.
3.  **Run Pipeline (Example Command)**:
    ```bash
    nextflow run main.nf -profile singularity \
        --input samplesheet.csv \
        --fasta <path_to_genome_fasta> \
        --gtf <path_to_genome_gtf> \
        --outdir ./results
    ```
    *(Note: Specific parameters will be defined during pipeline development.)*

## Shareability and Customization

*   **Git for Version Control**: The entire pipeline, including scripts and configurations, will be version-controlled with Git, facilitating sharing, collaboration, and tracking of changes.
*   **Nextflow for Reproducibility**: Nextflow's design, combined with containerization, ensures that the pipeline can be run by others, producing the same results from the same input data.
*   **Parameterized Design**: Key steps and tool choices will be parameterized, allowing users to easily adapt the pipeline to their specific datasets and biological questions via the `nextflow.config` file or command-line arguments.

This structured approach will help in developing a pipeline that is not only functional but also robust, easy to share, and adaptable for various scRNA-seq analysis needs. We can start by outlining the core Nextflow processes and gradually integrate the Python scripts for each analysis module.
